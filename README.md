# maimai-score-gallery
I really like rhythm games and maimai is my latest obsession. There are many beautiful fan-created services out there that help you with score tracking, but those tend to focus on the high points. I wanted to have a place where I could reminisce about my progression through various charts in the game.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tailwind components

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 through the official Vite plugin. It does not
need a `tailwind.config.js`. Project design tokens live in the `@theme` block
at the top of `src/styles.css`; for example, `--color-coral` creates utilities
such as `bg-coral`, `text-coral`, and `border-coral`.

Put reusable React components in `src/components/ui`. `StatCard.tsx` is an
example that accepts a `className` prop, allowing callers to extend it:

```tsx
<StatCard label="AP charts" className="bg-white/80">
  12
</StatCard>
```

Use utilities directly for one-off layouts. Extract a component when the same
visual pattern appears more than once.
